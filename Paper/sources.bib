  ABSTRACT = {Reducing the energy consumption of Internet services requires knowledge about the specific traffic and energy consumption characteristics, as well as the associated end-to-end topology and the energy consumption of each network segment. Here, we propose a shift from segment-specific to service-specific end-to-end energy-efficiency modeling to align engineering with activity-based accounting principles. We use the model to assess a range of the most popular instant messaging and video play applications to emerging augmented reality and virtual reality applications. We demonstrate how measurements can be conducted and used in service-specific end-to-end energy consumption assessments. Since the energy consumption is dependent on user behavior, we then conduct a sensitivity analysis on different usage patterns and identify the root causes of service-specific energy consumption. Our main findings show that smartphones are the main energy consumers for web browsing and instant messaging applications, whereas the LTE wireless network is the main consumer for heavy data applications such as video play, video chat and virtual reality applications. By using small cell offloading and mobile edge caching, our results show that the energy consumption of popular and emerging applications could potentially be reduced by over 80%.},

  pages={69058-69071},
  abstract={During mobile edge computing, due to the movement of nodes and the exhaustion of node energy, link failure occurs thus reducing the network lifetime in the mobile ad-hoc network. When the route fails, because the single-path protocols need to restart the route discovery process, the delay of the network is greatly increased. Therefore, the multi-path routing protocol is proposed, saving the cost of route discovery. In this paper, we propose an ad hoc on-demand multi-path distance vector (AOMDV) routing protocol based on link lifetime and energy consumption prediction (named LLECP-AOMDV) for mobile edge computing. In the route discovery phase, the energy grading strategy is adopted. When the node energy is lower than the threshold, it no longer participates in the route discovery. In the routing selected phase, the path is selected based on the lifetime of the route link and the minimum energy consumption of the route. According to energy consumption, packet delivery rate, end-to-end delay performance indicators, we evaluate the comparison results. The result shows that under most network performance indicators and parameters, the proposed LLECP-AOMDV is superior to the other three protocols, which improves the network lifetime, reduces the node’s energy consumption and the average end-to-end delay. The protocol is very useful for mobile edge computing.},

  abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) has shown tremendous potential as a means for computationally intensive mobile applications by partially or entirely offloading computations to a nearby server to minimize the energy consumption of user equipment (UE). However, the task of selecting an optimal set of components to offload considering the amount of data transfer as well as the latency in communication is a complex problem. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient deep learning based offloading scheme (EEDOS) to train a deep learning based smart decision-making algorithm that selects an optimal set of application components based on remaining energy of UEs, energy consumption by application components, network conditions, computational load, amount of data transfer, and delays in communication. We formulate the cost function involving all aforementioned factors, obtain the cost for all possible combinations of component offloading policies, select the optimal policies over an exhaustive dataset, and train a deep learning network as an alternative for the extensive computations involved. Simulation results show that our proposed model is promising in terms of accuracy and energy consumption of UEs.},

  ABSTRACT = {The rapidly increasing interest from various verticals for the upcoming 5th generation (5G) networks expect the network to support higher data rates and have an improved quality of service. This demand has been met so far by employing sophisticated transmission techniques including massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), millimeter wave (mmWave) bands as well as bringing the computational power closer to the users via advanced baseband processing units at the base stations. Future evolution of the networks has also been assumed to open many new business horizons for the operators and the need of not only a resource efficient but also an energy efficient ecosystem has greatly been felt. The deployment of small cells has been envisioned as a promising answer for handling the massive heterogeneous traffic, but the adverse economic and environmental impacts cannot be neglected. Given that 10% of the world&rsquo;s energy consumption is due to the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry, energy-efficiency has thus become one of the key performance indicators (KPI). Various avenues of optimization, game theory and machine learning have been investigated for enhancing power allocation for downlink and uplink channels, as well as other energy consumption/saving approaches. This paper surveys the recent works that address energy efficiency of the radio access as well as the core of wireless networks, and outlines related challenges and open issues.},

  abstract={For time and space constraints, 5G base stations will have more serious energy consumption problems in some time periods, so it needs corresponding sleep strategies to reduce energy consumption. Based on the analysis of 5G super dense base station network structure, through the analysis of current situation and user demand, a cluster sleep method based on genetic algorithm is constructed under the support of genetic algorithm, which can realize the dynamic matching of energy consumption in time domain and space, and the low load base station enters the sleep state. In order to verify the performance of the algorithm, the simulation network structure is built on the MATLAB platform, and the advantages of the algorithm in this study are obtained through comparative analysis, and the relevant test parameters are set for the technical performance analysis of this study. The research shows that the method proposed in this paper has a certain energy-saving effect, can meet the energy efficiency requirements of 5G ultra dense base station, and in the ultra dense base station group, the complexity can also meet the system operation requirements, which has a certain degree of practicality, and can provide reference for the follow-up related research.},

  abstract={Advanced Sleep Modes (ASMs) are defined as a progressive shutdown of the Base Station (BS) depending on the activation and the deactivation times of the different components. This transition duration defines different levels of sleep modes that can be implemented in future 5G networks. We propose in this paper a management strategy based on Q-learning approach which will enable to find the best combination and durations of ASM levels depending on the traffic load and the network operator's policy regarding energy reduction versus latency. Our results show that even in delay-sensitive scenarios, high energy gains can be achieved in low and moderate traffic loads, respectively 55% and 10%, without inducing an extra latency. Starting from a certain traffic load (approximately 30%), ASM should not be implemented in case of stringent latency constraint.},

  abstractNote={It is a critical requirement for the future of 5G communication networks to provide high speed and significantly reduce network energy consumption. In the Fifth Generation (5G), wireless cellular networks, smartphone battery efficiency, and optimal utilization of power have become a matter of utmost importance. Energy-efficient networks along with an energy-saving strategy in mobile devices play a vital role in the mobile revolution. The goal of energy efficiency, apart from its ecological value, is also associated with the reduction of operational expenses for mobile network operators, as well as with greater customer satisfaction thanks to increased battery life. Battery and power are an area of significant challenges considering that smartphones are nowadays equipped with advanced technological network features and interfaces. These features require a lot of simultaneous power to make decisions and to transfer information between devices and networks to provide the best user experience. Furthermore, to meet the demands of increased data capacity, data rate, and to provide the best quality of service, there is a need to adopt energy-efficient architectures. The new strategies should not only focus on wireless base stations, which consumes most of the power, but it should also take into consideration the other power consumption elements for future mobile communication networks, including User Equipment (UE).

  ABSTRACT = {Base stations represent the main contributor to the energy consumption of a mobile cellular network. Since traffic load in mobile networks significantly varies during a working or weekend day, it is important to quantify the influence of these variations on the base station power consumption. Therefore, this paper investigates changes in the instantaneous power consumption of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) base stations according to their respective traffic load. The real data in terms of the power consumption and traffic load have been obtained from continuous measurements performed on a fully operated base station site. Measurements show the existence of a direct relationship between base station traffic load and power consumption. According to this relationship, we develop a linear power consumption model for base stations of both technologies. This paper also gives an overview of the most important concepts which are being proposed to make cellular networks more energy-efficient.},

  abstract = {The explosive growth of mobile data traffic has resulted in a significant increase in the energy consumption of 5G base stations (BSs). However, the existing energy conservation technologies, such as traditional BS sleep strategy, rarely consider the dynamic real-time changes of users (UEs), which may make it difficult to maximize sleep idle or lightly loaded BSs, thereby affecting the reduction of BS energy consumption. Therefore, an energy consumption optimization strategy of 5G BSs considering variable threshold sleep mechanism (ECOS-BS) is proposed in this paper. Compared to current strategies, the ECOS-BS strategy can dynamically adjust BSs’ optimal sleep threshold on the premise of considering UEs’ dynamic changes, which is conducive to maximize sleep available BSs and realize the optimal management of BS energy consumption. Taking a heterogeneous cellular network as an example, numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.}
