\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
% Vision: why and what is this topic?
Since around 2010, mobile communication has been a vital part of everyday-life for most of the western world.
In 2007, we saw the launch of the iPhone, arguably one of the most influencial inventions in the mobile market ever.
With the introduction of 4G in late 2009 came a massive increase in mobile communication over the internet.
For almost one and a half decades, more and more technology has been invented for the mobile phone market.

In addition, the Oculus Rift has ushered in the reincarnation of the idea of Virtual Reality and spacial computing, plainly meaning the usage of 3D-space as a way to distribute user interfaces.
More and more, we rely on small, wireless devices with a sleek, modern and fashionable design and people seem to keep buying in. 
With that in mind, most mobile user equipment has had one spatial constraint that has so far never been overcome: Battery life and usage breaks to recharge at a wall socket.
This paper focuses on the effectiveness of energy consumption in respect to the overall environmental impact of modern mobile communications.
To this end, the following chapter~\ref{sec:relatedwork} summarizes other work done in the field and its topics.
Chapter~\ref{sec:energyfootprint} introduces a definition of environmental footprint and its relevance to this topic.
The chapters~\ref{sec:influence} and~\ref{sec:energyconsumption} go into detail about the energy production and consumption in Germany both in general and related to mobile communications.
Chapter~\ref{sec:opportunities} then names a few opportunities for saving energy.
